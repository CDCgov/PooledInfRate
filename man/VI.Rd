\details{

The vector index (VI) is a measure used to quantify the infectious burden in a population, such as the West Nile virus burden in populations of \emph{Culex} vector mosquito species. The language here is adopted from that for mosquito collections and testing for viral pathogens. The VI is computed as the sum over vector species (\eqn{i}{i}) of the average number of indivdiuals collected per collection effort ('trap night') \eqn{\overline{N}_i}{N_i} times an estimate of the infection prevalence or 'rate' \eqn{\widehat{p}_i}{p_i}, generally computed using pooled samples.  It is possible that not all indivdiuals are tested in a collection when computing the VI, so that the data set recording the numbers of individuals collected may be different or larger than that used in estimation of \code{p}.  To allow for a single data set to be used in computation of the VI, we permit data configuration and function parameter specifications (\code{n.use.na} and \code{n.no.traps}) to allow different data subsets to be used in computation of the components \eqn{\overline{N}_i}{N_i} and \eqn{\widehat{p}_i}{p_i}.


\code{formula} specification:  the formula is an extension of that used in the \code{\link{pooledBin}}/\code{\link{pIR}} functions; see the 'Details' section in their documentation. The extension in the formula specification to identify the variable representing the vector identifying variable is to include the variable after a 'forward slash' character.  Letting the variable \code{V} represent the vector variable, such as specification is then generically \code{X ~ m(M) + n(N) / V} when there is no grouping variable, and \code{X ~ m(M) + n(N) | G / V} when there is a grouping variable G.

Note that the vector variable \code{V} \emph{\bold{must}} come after the complete formula specification for the underlying \code{\link{pooledBin}}/\code{\link{pIR}} call, which includes, as needed, the grouping variable \code{G}.

A further extension to include differences in collection effort underlying the pools (e.g., the number of 'trap nights' a trap is set for mosquito trapping and all individuals in the pool are from traps set for the same amount of time), typically expressed in time of collection.  Let \code{T} represent this time variable.  Then this is included in the formula interface after a colon (:) separator \emph{after} the 'vector' variable, so extending the expression in the above paragraph:  \code{X ~ m(M) + n(N) / V:T} and \code{X ~ m(M) + n(N) | G / V:T} in the absence or presence of a grouping variable \code{G}, respectively.  By default, if such \code{T} is not specified, all collection efforts are set to the default unit 1.


Point estimate refers to underlying probability (infection rate) parameters used in the computation of the Vector Index, and they may be viewed in using a call to \code{summary}.  For point estimation of the probabilties (infection rates), the same options available for \code{pooledBin}/\code{pIR} are available here:  bias preventative ("firth") and bias corrected ("gart") estimators are recommended, with details described in Hepworth G, Biggerstaff BJ (2017). Use of MLE (\code{"mle"}), and MIR (\code{"mir"}) estimators is not recommended, but their computation is provided for historical reasons.

Note that confidence intervals are \emph{not reported} at this time for the Vector Index (even though there is an option for the method to use), as a direct population measure for inference is unclear; theoretical work on confidence intervals in this context therefore remains undeveloped.  Use of a confidence interval to accompany the Vector Index to aid characterization of uncertainty rather than for formal population inference may be justified, and inclusion of such in future releases of the PooledInfRate package is under consideration.
