\arguments{
    \item{x}{If an object of class formula (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic representation of the variables used to identify the number of positive pools, corresponding pool size, and number of pools of corresponding pool size, along with a required grouping variable.  See the 'Details' section below. Otherwise a vector, specifying the observed number of positive pools, among the number of pools tested (\code{n1}) in population 1}

  \item{data}{an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame) containing the variables specified in the formula. Records with mising data are omitted.}

  \item{m}{ a vector of corresponding pool sizes in population 1, must have the same length as \code{x1}}

  \item{x2}{ a vector, specifying the observed number of positive pools, among the number of pools tested (\code{n2}) in population 2}

  \item{m2}{ a vector of corresponding pool sizes in population 2, must have the same length as \code{x2}}

  \item{n}{ a vector of the corresponding number of pools with sizes \code{m1}}

  \item{n2}{ a vector of the corresponding number of pools with sizes \code{m2}}

  \item{group.names}{a character vector of length 2 for the names of the groups when using the default only; the names are taken from the grouping variable for the formula implementation}

  \item{pt.method}{a character string, specifying the point estimator to compute, with the following options: \code{"firth"}: recommended bias-corrected estimator (Hepworth & Biggerstaff, 2017), the default; \code{"gart"} bias-corrected MLE (Biggerstaff, 2008); \code{"bc-mle"}: same as \code{"gart"}, kept for backward compatibility ; \code{"mle"} MLE, and \code{"mir"} MIR. }

  \item{ci.method}{a character string, specifying the confidence interval to compute, with options: \code{"skew-score"} skewness-corrected, the default, \code{"score"} the score, \code{"bc-skew-score"} bias- and skewness-corrected
 \code{"lrt"} likelihood ratio test. See Biggerstaff (2008) for details. Further, the options \code{"wald"} wald and \code{"mir"} MIR are available but are not recommended.}
  \item{scale}{ a single numeric, coefficient to scale the point estimates and intervals bounds in the print and summary method (\code{\link{print.pooledBinDiff}}, \code{\link{summary.pooledBinDiff}}) }

  \item{alpha}{ a single numeric, specifying the type-I-error level}

  \item{tol}{accuracy required for iterations in internal functions}

  \item{\dots}{future arguments}

}

\details{

\code{formula} specification is the same as in \code{\link{pooledBin}/\link{pIR}}.  See the 'Details' there.

Differences in proportions are computed as detailed in Biggerstaff (2008).  All pairwise differences for groups specified using the grouping variable (formula method) or with the separate specifications (\code{x1},\code{x2}, etc.) are computed.  Note that no adjustment for multiple comparisons is made, so it is recommended to adjust \code{alpha} if such is needed.

As with estimation for groups indivdiually, point estimation: bias preventative ("firth") and bias corrected ("gart") estimators are recommended, with details described in Hepworth G, Biggerstaff BJ (2017). Use of MLE (\code{"mle"}), and MIR (\code{"mir"}) estimators is not recommended.

Confidence intervals: Note, that the methods "mir" and "wald" can not be recommended, because they return too narrow intervals in relevant situations, "mir" because it ignores the pooling, and "wald" because it relies on simple large sample methods. For computational details and simulation results of the remaining methods, see Biggerstaff (2008).}

# Consider an imaginary example, where pools of size
# 1, 5, 10 and 50 are tested, 5 pools of each size. The same
# design is applied to estimate the prevalence in
# two populations:
# In population 1, among the 5 pools with size 1 and 5,
# no positive pool is observed,
# while among the 5 pools of size 10 and 50, 1 and 2 positive
# pools are identified, respectively.

# In population 2, 1 positive result is observed
# among the 5 pools each pooling 5 elements,
# no positive result among the pools pooling 10 elements,
# 4 positive results among the pools pooling 50 elements,
