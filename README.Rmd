# PooledInfRate

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The PooledInfRate package provides functions to estimate proportions from pooled or group testing data.

## Installation

You can install PooledInfRate from GitLab:

``` r
# To install from GitLab CDC
# library(devtools) # need to install this if you do not have it
# This will build on the fly, so you need
# RTools (available from CRAN)
# and need to set
# Sys.setenv(R_QPDF="true") # for the build
# then 
devtools::install_git("https://git.cdc.gov/bkb5/PooledInfRate")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(PooledInfRate)
## basic example code
x <- c(1,0,0,0)
m <- c(50,25,10,5)
pooledBin(x,m)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
