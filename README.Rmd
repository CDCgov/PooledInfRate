PooledInfRate: Estimation from pooled or group testing.

The website for this project is <https://git.cdc.gov/bkb5/pooledinfrate.git/>.

PooledInfRate is an [R](www.r-project.org) package provides functions to estimate proportions from pooled or group testing data.  There is also functionality to estimate differences of such proportions.  Finally, for entomologists, there is functionality to compute the so-called "Vector Index" used to quantify the level of pathogen in vector species, such as the amount of West Nile virus in a population of vector mosquitoes.

## DISCLAIMER

While every effort has been made to ensure that that routines provide correct and accurate results, all responsibility for the use of the results belongs to the user.

## Installation

You can install PooledInfRate from GitLab:

``` r
# To install from GitLab CDC
# library(devtools) # need to install this if you do not have it
# This will build on the fly, so you need
# RTools (available from CRAN)
# and need to set
# Sys.setenv(R_QPDF="true") # for the build
# then 
devtools::install_git("https://git.cdc.gov/bkb5/PooledInfRate")
```

## Example

A couple of basic example with contrived data:

```{r example}
library(PooledInfRate)
## basic example code
x <- c(1,0,0,0)
m <- c(50,25,10,5)
pooledBin(x,m)

pool.dat <- data.frame(Pos = c(1,1,0,0), PoolSize = c(100,50,25,10), NumPools = c(5,8,2,3))
pooledBin(Pos ~ PoolSize, data = pool.dat)
pIR(Pos ~ PoolSize + n(NumPools), data = pool.dat) # pIR is just a short name for 'pooledBin'
```

See the package vignette for detailed examples of the methods and user interface, along with references for the methods.
